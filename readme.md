##Twitter bot



First time I tried a Twitter Bot was at a Meetup in 2 hours or less so there wasn't much time to get it right. I've decided to re-create it with more purpose!

Follow [@codelikeahuffle](https://twitter.com/codelikeahuffle) to see it live!

###Things You Need To Re-Create

[Twit Documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/twit)
Yep, love on this documentation.
Also, to run your bot:
<code>$node bot.js </code>
